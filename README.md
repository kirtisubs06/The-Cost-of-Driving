## Description
The program prompts the user for three pieces of information: the car's fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon), the price per gallon of gas, and the number of gallons of gas currently in the tank. Using these inputs, it calculates the cost of driving 100 miles and how far the car can go with the gas left in the tank. It then displays these calculations along with the input values to the user in a clear and informative way.

## Features
- **User Input:** Receives user input for fuel efficiency, gas price, and current fuel level.
- **Cost Calculation:** Calculates the cost of driving 100 miles based on fuel efficiency and gas price.
- **Distance Calculation:** Determines the total miles the car can drive with the current fuel level.
- **Output Display:** Clearly prints the input values and calculated results back to the user.

## Usage
### Running the Program
The program starts by asking the user to input the fuel efficiency, gas price, and current fuel level. After receiving the inputs, it performs the necessary calculations and displays the results.

### Example Interaction
```python
# Input
What is the fuel efficiency of your car (in miles per gallon)? 25
What is the price per gallon of gas for your car? 4.099
What is the number of gallons of gas currently in the tank of your car? 5

# Output
The fuel efficiency of your car is 25 miles per gallon.
The price per gallon of gas for your car is $4.099.
Your car currently has 5 gallons in its tank.
The cost of the gas when you drive 100 miles is $409.90.
Your car can go 125 miles with the gas that is currently in the tank.

# Process finished with exit code 0
